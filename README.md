# ReviewBot
A Discord bot made with DiscordJS and NodeJS. Tracks scores and leaderboards for a fantasy food-review league.

### Note
This is still a rough build. While this bot works as described the code is still pretty messy. In the next commit I'll clean up some of the redundant code (example: multiple module.exports), refactor a bit, rename some functions/arguments for clarity, and split the code up into multiple files so it's easier to digest.
